# Practice data analysis in Python - COVID-19

Resources for Python practice using COVID-19 data include:

## Practice problems for new Python users

These materials are most appropriate if you've completed [Intro to Python](https://fredhutchio.github.io/python_intro/)
from [fredhutch.io](http://www.fredhutch.io).
The notebook repository called [`practice-covid-19-python-intro.ipynb`](practice-covid-19-python-intro.ipynb)
includes instructions on downloading the [tidy version of the Johns Hopkins global data](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus),
followed by practice problems similar to those covered in the Intro to Python course materials.

To prepare for work on this project,
we recommend creating a new directory to hold all files associated with this project.
You then have two options to obtain the practice problems:

1. Click on [this link](covid-19-python-intro.ipynb)
to view the notebook's page on GitHub.
Click on the button labeled "Raw" on the righthand side of the screen.
Save the contents to a file named "covid-19-python-intro.ipynb"
in your project directory.
(Note: it may be easier to right-click on "Raw" and use the "Download linked file" option).
Once the notebook has been downloaded,
launch your Jupyter notebook interface,
navigate to your project directory,
and open the notebook.
You should be ready to download the data and proceed with the practice problems.
2. Create a new notebook using the Jupyter interface
(or whatever Python IDE you prefer).
Copy content (code chunks, etc)
from [this notebook](covid-19-python-intro.ipynb)
into your own copy.
If you cannot view the notebook on GitHub using the previous link,
try [this one](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/fredhutchio/practice-covid-19/blob/master/Python/covid-19-python-intro.ipynb).

Answers for practice problems are available [here](solutions).

## Example projects

Kairsten Fay, a Fred Hutch community member,
began to develop an [analysis of United States COVID-19 cases](https://github.com/kairstenfay/data-viz/blob/master/covid-19/COVID-19.ipynb).
If Kairsten's notebook isn't rendering on GitHub using the link above,
try [this link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kairstenfay/data-viz/blob/master/covid-19/COVID-19.ipynb).
