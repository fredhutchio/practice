# Practice data analysis - COVID-19

This repository includes resources and examples for scientific researchers interested in improving their developing coding skills.
These materials are maintained by the training and community team at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.
For more information on data analysis and computing at Fred Hutch,
please see the [Fred Hutch Biomedical Data Science Wiki](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org).

This repository focuses on data from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University,
representing continuously updated [global COVID-19 data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) from a wide variety of sources.
Rami Krispin maintains a project that continuously updates a [tidy version of the Johns Hopkins data](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus);
the exercises in this repository will focus on this tidy dataset.

We've included challenge exercises and suggestions for developing larger-scale projects for both [R](R) and [Python](Python).
Please see the READMEs for each directory to get started.
