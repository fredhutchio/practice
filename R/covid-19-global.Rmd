These data represent XXX
and are available through an R package.
You can learn more at the [website for the package](https://ramikrispin.github.io/coronavirus/index.html),
as well as the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).

Load the data:

```{r}
library(coronavirus)

data("coronavirus")
```

Note that you need to use `install.packages("coronavirus")`
the first time you use the package on a computer,
and every time you would like to receive updated data
(the repository is updated daily).
